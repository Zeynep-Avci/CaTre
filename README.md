# CaTre

“CaTre” is an easy-to-use, free productivity app with gamification features. The goal of the app is to help users take better care of their cats. Within the app, the user will have a virtual cat that starves when not fed and gets disgusted when the litter box is not cleaned. The user has to check, for instance, the cleaning task when she or he cleans the litter box in real life. The user can get to a higher level when the tasks are done for a certain amount of time. The user can see how many points she or he gathered from taking care of their virtual cat. Badges can be unlocked, when required points are collected. And so, taking care of a cat is simulated in a game. The targeted audience for the app is anyone who owns a cat. This target group could range from children to old people. The app will offer users easy navigation and a user-friendly UI. The app will be launched as an Android application on the user's device.
